Usage: $0 [OPTION] network_nix [ network2_nix ... ]

The command \`disnixos-clean-snapshots' removes all older snapshot generations
stored on the machines in the network.

Options:
      --interface=INTERFACE   Path to executable that communicates with a Disnix
                              interface. Defaults to \`disnix-ssh-client'
      --target-property=PROP  The target property of an infrastructure model,
                              that specifies how to connect to the remote Disnix
      --keep=NUM              Amount of snapshot generations to keep. Defaults
                              to: 1
      --use-nixops            Use NixOps instead of Disnix for infrastructure
                              deployment
  -h, --help                  Shows the usage of this command to the user
  -v, --version               Shows the version of this command to the user

Environment:
  DISNIX_CLIENT_INTERFACE    Sets the client interface (which defaults to
                             \`disnix-ssh-client'
  DISNIX_TARGET_PROPERTY     Specifies which property in the infrastructure Nix
                             expression specifies how to connect to the remote
                             interface (defaults to: hostname)
  DISNIXOS_USE_NIXOPS        When set to 1, it specifies that NixOps is used to
                             take care of the infrastructure deployment, so that
                             it properly interprets NixOps configurations and
                             uses NixOps tooling instead of Disnix's deployment
                             facilities.
