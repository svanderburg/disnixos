The command \`disnixos-query' collects and displays all the installed services
from the machines defined in a given infrastructure model.

Options:
  -p, --profile=PROFILE       Name of the profile in which the services are
                              registered. Defaults to: default

                              interface. Defaults to \`disnix-ssh-client'
      --target-property=PROP  The target property of an infrastructure model,
                              that specifies how to connect to the remote Disnix
                              interface. (Defaults to hostname)
      --use-nixops            Use NixOps instead of Disnix for infrastructure
                              deployment
  -h, --help                  Shows the usage of this command to the user

  DISNIX_CLIENT_INTERFACE    Sets the client interface (which defaults to
                             \`disnix-ssh-client'
  DISNIX_TARGET_PROPERTY     Specifies which property in the infrastructure Nix

                             interface (defaults to: hostname)
  DISNIX_PROFILE             Sets the name of the profile that stores the
                             manifest on the coordinator machine and the
                             deployed services per machine on each target
                             (Defaults to: default)
